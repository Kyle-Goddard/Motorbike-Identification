# Motorbike-Identification
Part of going through the fastai course involved transfer learning. One particular project involved training a deep neural network (resnet34) to differentiate between species of bears (grizzly bear, black bear, teddy bear etc.). I was interested to apply this technique to something that interests me more than bears. Namely: Motorcycles! Thus, the current project is an attempt to train a deep neural network to identify the different "species" of motorcycles from pictures.

There are a few possible Motorcycle form factors which I have tried to identify:
- Adventure Bikes
- Naked Bikes / Street Fighters
- High Performance Street Bikes 
- Motorcross (MX) Bikes
- SuperMoto
