# Motorbike-Identification
Part of going through the fastai course involved transfer learning. One particular project involved training a resnet to differentiate between species of bears (grizzly bear, black bear, teddy bear etc.). I was interested to apply this technique to something that interests me more than bears. Namely: Motorcycles! Thus, the current project is an attempt to train a deep neural network to identify the different brands of motorcycles from pictures.
